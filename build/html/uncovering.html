<dt>OPTIONS:</dt><dd><ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li><p>Some of the objects archaeologists find have been preserved in various ways. Experiment with preserving a hot dog with baking soda. Measure each dimension, then completely surround and cover the hot dog in baking soda. Let sit in a safe place for seven days, and measure again. Then cover the hot dog again, let it sit another seven days, and measure it a third time. Make note of any changes in size, shape, color, and other properties. Compare it to a hot dog that has not been preserved. Discuss your experiment with your counselor.</p></li>

<h2>What will we do during the meeting?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-will-we-do-during-the-meeting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><strong>Explore</strong>. Do EACH of the following:</p>
<ol class="upperalpha">
<li><p>We will look up the definition of the word <em>archaeology</em> and discover what an archaeologist does on a dig site, and what other activities are involved in their work.</p>
<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="admonition-title">Hint</p>
<p>Archaeology is the study of the human past by recovering and analyzing materials that people left behind.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Discover the differences between physical remains, artifacts, and ecofacts. Discuss with your counselor examples of each that archaeologists can find for a prehistoric people group.</p>
<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="admonition-title">Hint</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>An artifact is any object made by a human being. Usually, it refers to an object that has cultural or historical interest.</p></li>
<li><p>An ecofact, or biofact, is any organic material that has been recovered and has cultural or historical significance. This might be bones, animal horns, plants, and so on. If the item has been manipulated or modified by humans, it becomes an artifact.</p></li>
<li><p>Physical remains are things left behind that were part of an animal- for example, body parts or fossils of body parts.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Look around your house.</strong> Make a list of 10 artifacts from your home that serve as clues to the way you live. Discuss what you discovered with your counselor. <strong>*We will take time during the meeting for a miniature scavenger hunt for the scouts to find potential artifacts in their houses.</strong></p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Artifacts could include anything found lying around the Scout’s house. A dog crate could indicate the family has kept domesticated animals. A hammer could indicate they know how to use tools. Ask the Scouts to pretend they have never seen a particular item before, and what might they think it is.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Be an archaeologist!</strong>  You will create your own layers of artifacts and ecofacts. Gather some small items that would show future archaeologists how you and your family lived. Use a plastic bottle or glass jar as the vessel and Play-Doh sand, dirt, etc., to form layers. Place the gathered items in different layers. Think about which layers would hold the older items compared to newer ones. Show it to your counselor, and discuss with your counselor why you chose these items and what they would show archaeologists about how you lived. Excavate your items when you’re done.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p><em>Parents*</em>: make sure you have a tall, clear cup or jar, some small items, and playdough or sand ready for the scouts to build their layers. Put down some cloths or newspaper to avoid any mess during the excavation portion.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>4. Visit a place that has items that have been excavated, such as a museum, dig
site, historical society, etc. Talk to someone who works there about the displays. If you can’t visit in person, use resources in your school or local library or on the internet (with your parent’s or guardian’s permission and guidance) to take a virtual visit. Discuss with your counselor what you saw, how the archaeologists helped uncover those items, and what questions you had.</p>
<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="admonition-title">Hint</p>
<p>We will do this virtually!</p>
</div>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li><p>Discuss with your counselor what you have learned about archaeology while working on this award.</p></li>

What will we do during the meeting?
-----------------------------------

1.  Complete all of the following:

    (a) Using toothpicks and colored marshmallows, or other appropriate materials, make a model of the crystal structure of olivine.
    (b) Using toothpicks and colored marshmallows, or other appropriate materials, make a model of the crystal structure of halite.
    (c) Use your models to guess which of the two minerals is harder.

    .. note::

       For this, Cubs will need toothpicks and small marshmallows (or something similar - gum drops, gummy bears, skewers and big marshmallows, etc)

2. We will complete the following two activities:

   A. Make a paper lantern

      1. Fold a large piece of paper in quarters lengthwise.
      2. Cut decorative or symbolic shapes into the two folded edges.
      3. Unfold, tape the two edges of the paper together, and smooth into a cylinder. Hang by a string.

      .. note::

	 For this, Cubs should have a piece of construction paper, scissors and 3 pieces of string or yarn that are 8-12” long.

   B.  Learn about the design of Navajo rugs.

       1. Look at some pictures of Navajo rugs. Find as many similarities as possible within each rug. Is there a repeated pattern? Is there a mirror image? How many?
       2.  Using different colors of paper, or other materials, make your own Navajo-like rug.

       .. note::

	  For this, Cubs should have graph paper and some different colored markers, pencils, etc.


3. Visit a place where symmetry is important (such as an art exhibit, building site, or printer) or visit with a person who works with symmetry (such as an artist, interior designer, or landscape architect). Discuss with your counselor the symmetry or ideas of balance involved.

   We will take a virtual tour of Jason Nemec’s wood shop in Charlton, NY. He will show us how he uses symmetry to sculpt bowls out of trees!

4. Discuss with your counselor how symmetry impacts your everyday life.

Welcome to the website for the *Cub Scout Nova Quest* website!

Here you will find all the information you need for each of the 11 Nova Awards offered during this program. We have assembled all the activities in 11 different pages. Only worry about those for which of you have registered!

How can you use this site? You will find contact information, the list of pre-requisites, a preview of the activities that will take place during the meetings, and links to submit your pre-requisites to the instructors! You will even find a few words about each instructor on each page. Isn't that cool?

Most important: you will find the zoom link on each page to join the meetings!

If you have any question, please do not hesitate to contact us!

Pre-requisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is a pre-requisite? It is an activity you should complete *before* the meeting! Here is a list of pre-requisites you should do to complete this Award. If you do not have time to complete it **before** the day of the activity, do not despair! You can always send your work later to your instructor at the address listed above!

1. Requirement #1 (Choose A or B or C and complete ALL of the requirements)

   A. Watch not less than one hour total of shows or documentaries that discuss fluid dynamics or a show related to fluid dynamics. Then do the following 

      1. Make a list of at least two questions or ideas from the show(s) you watched.
      2. Discuss two of the questions with or ideas with your counselor.

   B. Read not less than one hour total about a topic related to fluid dynamics. Then do the following:

      1. Make a list of at least two questions or ideas from the article(s) you read.
      2. Discuss two of the questions with or ideas with your counselor.

   C. Do a combination of reading and watching (not less than one hour total). Then do the following:

      1. Make a list of at least two questions or ideas from each article or show.

   .. note:: 

      Some examples of shows to watch include—but are not limited to—`The STEM of
      Indoor Skydiving <https://youtu.be/V5jJ5FaX1ZU>`__; documentaries produced by PBS (such as 
      “NOVA”), the Discovery Channel, Science Channel, National Geographic Channel, and the History 
      Channel; or lectures or presentations focused on science, technology, engineering, or math (such as 
      `TED Talks <https://www.ted.com>`__) using some search terms you might think of using could include “fluid 
      dynamics for kids” or “the science of skydiving for kids.” You may watch online productions with 
      your counselor’s approval and under your parent’s or guardian’s supervision. You may choose to 
      watch a live performance or movie at a planetarium or science museum instead of watching a media production.

      If you are a fan of Bill Nye the Science Guy... a couple of other videos you could watch would include:

      1. Bill Nye the Science Guy Sea 05 Epis 13 Fluids - `Bing video <https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=fluid+dynamics+for+kids&&view=detail&mid=5A34B2890BB1367AC3955A34B2890BB1367AC395&&FORM=VRDGAR&ru=%2Fvideos%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dfluid%2Bdynamics%2Bfor%2Bkids%26qpvt%3Dfluid%2Bdynamics%2Bfor%2Bkids%26FORM%3DVDRE>`__
      2. Bill Nye the Science Guy S02E19 Atmosphere - `Bing video <https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=fluid+dynamics+for+kids&ru=%2fvideos%2fsearch%3fq%3dfluid%2bdynamics%2bfor%2bkids%26qpvt%3dfluid%2bdynamics%2bfor%2bkids%26FORM%3dVDRE&view=detail&mid=43D5F14F9A0903CB928943D5F14F9A0903CB9289&rvsmid=FC1AEECA4DB6D886EE55FC1AEECA4DB6D886EE55&FORM=VDQVAP>`__
      3. `Bill Nye The Science Guy on Wind (Full Clip) - <Bill Nye The Science Guy on Wind (Full Clip)>`__

   If watching videos is not your thing you may select an article and read for an hour.  A couple of good places to look include:

      1. Fluid dynamics Facts for Kids (`kiddle.co <https://kids.kiddle.co/Fluid_dynamics#:~:text=Fluid%20dynamics%20facts%20for%20kids.%20Fluid%20Dynamics%20talks,The%20fluid%20dynamics%20of%20gases%20are%20called%20aerodynamics>`__)
      2. What Is Fluid Dynamics? (`Live Science <https://www.livescience.com/47446-fluid-dynamics.html>`__)

   In both cases prepare at least to jot down at least 2 questions based on your study for us to discuss in class.

.. warning:: Pre-req submissions

   Finally, have your cub scouts **ENTER** their pre work in this `form <>`__ before April 5\ :sup:`th` to allow us to create a truly interactive and personalized learning experience. If you are late that is OK, please still fill it out up to our scheduled 3:30 class. Feel free to contact the instructor (See email in blue box at the top of this page)


What will we do during the meeting?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Among other things, we will study airplanes:

We will be using both a pin wheel and a paper airplane as part of studying Bernoulli's Law and Fluid Dynamics.

**Scouts should make their pinwheel and airplane before the event as outlined in the following**:

1. How to Make a Paper Airplane | `HGTV <https://www.hgtv.com/design/make-and-celebrate/handmade/how-to-make-a-paper-airplane>`__
2. How to Make Pinwheels | Easy Paper Pinwheel Tutorial -`One Little Project <https://onelittleproject.com/how-to-make-a-pinwheel/>`__

**We will fly our paper airplane several times during our session so plan on having about a 10 foot long unobstructed area in which to fly where if your airplane hits anything there will not be any damage**

.. warning::

   **Welcome to the Twin Rivers Council Cub Scout Nova Quest website!**

   Here you will find all the information you need for each of the 11 Cub Scout Nova Awards offered during the Nova Quest program. Each Nova Award has its own page. Only focus on those for which of you have registered!

   How can you use this site? You will find contact information, the list of pre-requisites (i.e. things you should do before the Zoom meeting), a preview of the activities that will take place during the Zoom meetings, and links to submit your pre-requisites to the instructors! You will even find a few words about each instructor on each page. Isn't that cool?

   Most important: you will find the Zoom link on each page to join the meetings!

   If you have any question, please do not hesitate to contact us!
